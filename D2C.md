## What Is Direct-to-Consumer Selling?

A direct-to-consumer business model involves manufacturers selling their products directly to end customers, skipping third-party retailers, wholesalers, and distributors. 

D2C is a significant move away from the traditional model, where manufacturers sell to wholesalers to distribute to retail stores. While the latter model may still be alive, the Internet, rising consumer expectations, and the pandemic have turned it on its head.

## Manufacturer’s Benefits of Direct Selling to Consumer

But isn’t it bad for brands to compete against their wholesalers and retailers? What are the benefits of breaking the traditional manufacturer > wholesaler > retailer > consumer model?

##### Here are our top five advantages of direct sales by manufacturers to consumers:

**Brand control:** Brand image isn’t subject to distortion or dilution by third parties.
**Price control:** Direct selling allows you to reinforce MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) and communicate directly with consumers about price points.
**Expanded selling base:** Brands can make their own sales without fully relying on retailers to finalize transactions.
**Faster time to market:** Instead of the long traditional retail sales cycle that requires locked-in product development well in advance of order and delivery, you can prototype, test, and move to market quickly. Agility is a critical differentiator in competitive industries.
**Potential to build stronger customer relationships:** When customers buy direct, you collect a goldmine of data. There’s a massive opportunity for brands to use this information to create personalized promotions and marketing campaigns to build ongoing relationships with consumers. 
**Increased brand loyalty and customer engagement**
**Innovation is quicker and happens more often**
**Scaling is easier** The D2C business model is highly digital, enabling companies to reach customers all over the world and gradually reduce their geographic restrictions as the business grows and expands its operational capacities.
**Higher profit margins** Cutting out any third parties enables D2C companies to reduce costs that would normally go to wholesalers and distributors. The extra income can be invested in enhancing your customer experience and strengthening your marketing efforts so you can reach and connect with more of your customer base.
**Direct access to customer data** Understanding your customers, their preferences and how they interact with your products and services can enable you to:

   - Build better, more personalised offerings
   - Optimise existing products and services
   - Boost your marketing efforts 

A middleman normally has direct access to this valuable data. D2C businesses, on the other hand, have direct relationships with their customers, enabling them to gain real insight into their preferences, their needs and even test new products and services before they launch.


## Cons of D2C business model

**Complex supply chains.** You’ll be juggling a lot more aspects of your business (e.g. orders, shipments, transport, payments, returns, customer care), increasing not only your responsibilities but your points of vulnerability.
**Increased liability** Going D2C gives brands complete control over their operations, but that also comes with increased liability for things usually shared with third parties (e.g. shipping, sensitive customer and financial data, cybersecurity breaches).
**Increased competition** The D2C landscape has changed quite a bit in the last decade, with more and more companies leveraging the strategy to compete for the same customers. Not too long ago, there were a handful of startups selling glasses, makeup and a few consumer packaged goods, today it’s corporations like Comcast, Verizon and Amazon making their entrance into the arena.

## How Can Manufacturers Sell Direct to Consumers?

Computers, shoes, shaving gear, even cars – today, there are so many products that are sold directly to consumers by the manufacturer. But it wasn’t always so easy. Previously, for a manufacturer direct to consumer selling meant a massive capital investment in physical stores and additional employees. 

Now the investment is much smaller, and it is in digital transformation and technology. Online shopping provides a way for consumers to go to the store without leaving home. A single eCommerce-enabled website is the equivalent of a store on every corner in every city. Digital marketing gives brands a greater reach and a personalized communication channel with current and potential customers. Advances in distribution allow faster, doorstep deliveries.

The key is a strategy that enables the different elements to work together to deliver digital experiences your customers want.

ECommerce technology is playing a significant role in this. But don’t stop at just providing product search, ordering, and checkout. Consider advanced eCommerce solutions that allow you to meet consumers’ high expectations in terms of customization, localization, payments, and delivery.

## Assessing and Mitigating the Risks of Selling Direct

If you see the rise of online shopping and eCommerce as a catalyst for a strategic change in your company, mind the risks associated with direct selling to customers. These risks merit careful consideration and a mitigation plan.

**The Risk** The first risk is damage to existing relationships. Retailers and wholesalers can react negatively to what they perceive as competition for the brand. It is imperative to openly communicate your plans before they are implemented. Transparency is the key.

**The Mitigation** Squash the perception that selling direct is the opening salvo in a brand versus retailer/wholesaler war. Maintain focus on consumer satisfaction. If the customer isn’t happy, nobody will be happy. Remind sellers that many consumers will continue to demand access to multiple brands, which you cannot provide. Do provide exclusive products to your wholesale/retail channels. These can be exclusive sizes, colors, or finishes that you will not sell direct.

**The Risk.** Manufacturers selling direct to consumers need to have a deep understanding of retail sales and customer expectations. A manufacturer that leaps into the direct market without the proper infrastructure and human assets will only damage their brand.

**The Mitigation.** Make sure you have the shipping and customer service infrastructure in place to support direct consumer sales. Incorporate features such as chat and click to dial in your website design to make it easy for customers to contact you. Your social media presence must be trained to listen as well as interact. Be prepared to ship quickly and handle returns flawlessly

## Making the Move: Selling Direct to Consumers

If you’re joining the legions of manufacturers selling direct to consumers, you’ll need a comprehensive digital strategy. The most important decision you make will be selecting the platform for your eCommerce operations to support both of your sales channels – B2B and B2C. It must be powerful enough to operate out-of-the-box and flexible enough to customize for your company’s needs. You’ll need to consider such logistics as:

    - Order fulfillment and tracking
    - Payment security
    - Customer service management
    - Sales and marketing activities tracking
    - 360° view of all your B2B and B2C customer interactions

Channel selection will drive many of the decisions. Remember to keep retailers and wholesalers informed. Manufacturers selling direct (or rather selling both ways) is the next big wave in commerce.
